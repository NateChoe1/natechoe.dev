@=header Some possible fronts for criminal organizations@

<p><a href=https://www.abuseipdb.com/>AbuseIPDB</a> is a database of abusive IP
address, that <a href=https://www.abuseipdb.com/user/88209>I contribute to</a>.
Basically, a bunch of system administrators (people that run servers) have
scripts that detect and report any malicious activity. For my system, I have <a
href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban>Fail2ban</a> set up so that any IP
addresses that make a single failed login get banned for 24 hours and
reported.</p>

<p>This is a really strict Fail2ban policy, and probably wouldn't be acceptable
for most use cases. I can only use it because I'm the only person accessing my
own servers, so if something goes wrong it's my fault. I first adopted this
policy after realizing that I was reporting <a
href=https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/194.169.175.17>the same IP address hundreds
of times</a>. This IP address (194.169.175.17) belongs to <a
href=https://emanuelhosting.info/>Emanuel Hosting</a>, a web service provider
offering some really good rates. Never mind the fact that their servers are in
the UK but their address is New Hampshire, or that they always seem to be out of
stock, or that trying to buy bare metal servers leads to a 404, or that their
terms of service, privacy policy, and acceptable use policy all lead to a 404,
or that they never responded to my abuse complaint, despite claiming that they
"respond within 12 hours", or that they claim to have 89,099 deployed servers
despite the fact that their autonomus system (AS394711) only has 6656 IP
addresses.</p>

<p>Everything seems to point to Emanuel Hosting being a badly designed front for
some criminal organization. I'm not going to claim outright that they actually
are, I'm just saying is that the log in and support buttons lead to the Emanuel
Hosting homepage, and not to their actual pages. Also, I'm a legal adult now,
and Emanuel Hosting could actually sue me for defamation if I'm wrong about
this.</p>

<p>These sorts of sites aren't too hard to find, just go to your email's spam
folder and look for a link. Here's a spam email that I received at the beginning
of this month.</p>

   Hello! You asked where I saw your photos, in this link -
   [1]https://google.com/pics/293e9e

<p>There's a lot to unpack here. Let's actually start with the headers. This
email is "from" info@@sonyliv.com, but SPF failed and there's no DKIM headers,
which strongly indicates that someone is badly forging the "from" header. In
2024, any decent email provider should mark these emails as spam, which means
that spammers have to buy a domain and set up SPF and DKIM just to reach their
mark. These protections don't make spam impossible, but they definitely raise
the bar to entry.</p>

<p>Another interesting note is that the IP address that actually sent this email
is in Russia, but whoever sent it is pretending to be the Chinese website
visitbeijing.com.cn and spoofing the email of an Indian company.</p>

<p>The Google link doesn't actually lead anywhere, it's actually just disguising
some other fishy URL. The original HTML source code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class=block>@\
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
</head>
<body bgColor="#ffffff">
<div align=left><font size=2 face=Arial>Hello! You asked where I saw your photos, in this link - <a href="https://un22pry.bigbonusleader.life/df3prg9?m=1">https://google.com/pics/293e9e</a><br></font></div></body></html>
@</code></pre>

<p>You can actually disguise any URL as any other URL in HTML. For example, try
clicking this link to <a
href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>https://natechoe.dev</a>. The
email uses this trick to disguise the real url,
https://un22pry.bigbonusleader.life/df3prg9?m=1. The base URL
bigbonusleader.life just says "Under construction". The page in the email seems
to have some spammy "Hot Singles in YOUR AREA!" type HTML, but it then redirects
to some page in search.weekmomeet.live. This redirects to various other pages in
a chain of 4 websites. There seem to be some checks in there to redirect you to
google.com if you're making too many connections or you're taking too long to
access each page, although I'm not entirely sure how to replicate this.</p>

<p>The chain eventually ends in a subdomain of deviceconnectnetwork.co.in, which
has a fake captcha screen.</p>

<img src=deviceconnect-base.png alt="Fake captcha displayed on deviceconnectnetwork.co.in">

<p>Clicking on the captcha leads the page to ask for notifications.</p>

<img src=deviceconnect-notif.png alt="deviceconnectnetwork.co.in
asking for notifications">

<p>I stopped here because I didn't want some random spammer sending me
notifications. I don't think they'd send anything interesting for a while
anyways.</p>

<p>It's interesting that they put the captcha before asking for notifications.
Modern javascript is really, really powerful. In the early 2000s, after
javascript became powerful but before browser developers made it secure, you
could basically embed malware in a website. The infamous <a
href=https://youareanidiot.cc/>"you are an idiot"</a> trojan would, as the name
suggests, call you an idiot. When you tried to close the website, however, it
would spawn six new copies of itself. Closing one of those copies would spawn
six more, and so on. Eventually you'd have hundreds of browser windows open and
be forced to shut down your computer.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there are protections against this sort of stuff. For example, in
most web browsers, you can only create one popup per click or key press, which
makes javascript a lot safer to run. I assume that's why that spammy website had
that initial "I am not a robot" button; they have to make the user click to ask
for permissions.</p>

<p>A lot of times, spammers will take over some legitimate website and use their
infrastructure to host malicious stuff. deviceconnectnetwork.co.in is probably
not one of these cases. The base deviceconnectnetwork.co.in domain has a website
that was very, very obviously generated by an LLM. They claim to be "A Blog
about Everything" and to have "5,000 Articles Published", despite the fact that
they have three articles on the entire site. They claim that they've had "10
Years of Storytelling", despite the fact that the deviceconnectnetwork.co.in
domain was registered in March of this year. The domain is
deviceconnectnetwork.co.in, but the top bar on their website says "Evocative
Musings", and the home page says "Eclectic Musings".</p>

<p>Again, maybe I'm wrong about this. All I'm saying is that the Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn logos at the bottom of the site don't actually
lead anywhere, and that the headers in their privacy policy aren't properly
formatted.</p>

<p>The existence of these criminal-looking organizations isn't really a secret.
If you host a server on the internet and check the logs in an hour, you'll
probably find some malicious activity. These people's modus operandi is to
attack as many systems as they can completely automatically. These people don't
want to hack you specifically, they want to hack as many people as they can,
including you. They set up fake websites and organizations to (badly) disguise
themselves and scripts to target the entire internet. On a global level, we
protect against this with checks like SPF, DKIM, and javascript restrictions. On
an individual level we protect against this with common sense, like "don't click
on random links in your spam folder", and "keep all your software up to date".
These people will never go away, but we can at least keep them at bay.</p>
