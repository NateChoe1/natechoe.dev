		<h1>natechoe.dev is now dockerized</h1>
		<p>natechoe.dev has gone through several infrastructure changes, going from a debian vm on a windows server host, to a gentoo vm on a windows server host, then my Dad and I dockerized the reverse proxy that distinguished the different self hosted sites we own, and now natechoe.dev is dockerized. To host your own instance of natechoe.dev, just run</p>
		<code>docker run natechoe/natechoe.dev -p 49100:49100</code>
		<p>After running this, natechoe.dev will run on port 49100.</p>
