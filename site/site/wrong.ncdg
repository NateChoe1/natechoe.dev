		<h1>You're in the wrong place.</h1>

		<p>Why would you even put the www. in front of natechoe.dev? Not
		only is it unnecessary, it takes active effort to do so. I'm not
		even going to put in a hyperlink for you, you have to manually
		remove the www. now since you seem to love putting in extra
		effort to show a web page for some reason.</p>

		<p>In fact, out of pure spite, I've taken special care and
		attention to make this part of the site look terrible. This is
		probably going to absolutely tank my SEO but I don't care. It's
		worth it to me to make you suffer.</p>
