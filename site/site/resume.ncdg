<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I remember the first piece of code I ever wrote. I was in second grade when
my Dad showed me the Scratch programming language on his computer. When it was
my turn to play with it, I wrote a program to make the cat run in circles around
the screen. I saw how I could connect blocks together and make the computer do
something tangible. I was instantly hooked. I haven't stopped writing code
since.</p>

<p>That love for making real things is reflected in the way I approach learning.
I believe that the best way to truly understand something is to do it yourself.
Whenever I learn something new, I always ask "can I model this?" If I can't,
then I haven't learned enough. If I can, then I often do just to make sure.
That's why I wrote a web server, a password manager, a program to parse big
data, and a raytracer.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>C - My favorite programming language. I learned it around two years ago and
use it almost exclusively today.</p>
<p>Java - I've used Java for around seven years, it's what got me really into
writing code.</p>
<p>Python - The first programming language I ever learned, I first used it ten
years ago.</p>
<p>Linux - I've been using Linux seriously for around four years.</p>

<h2>Experiences</h2>

<p>Open Source Summit 2023 - Listened to various talks on the state of systems
in Linux.</p>
<p>Knowledge sharing sessions with working programmers - listened to and shared
talks with real programmers and project managers from Amazon and Google. <a
target=_blank href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTePjR51sYE>One of my
talks</a> got over 11 thousand views on my Dad's YouTube channel.</p>
